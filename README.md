# Scrapy-Book-Scraper

## Introduction
Scrapy-Book-Scraper is a web scraping project built using the Scrapy framework. This project is designed for educational purposes to facilitate learning about web scraping and its role in data extraction for AI and ML applications. With Scrapy-Book-Scraper, you can extract data from multiple pages of a website that lists books, capturing every detail about each book. The scraper utilizes a sophisticated technique of rotating fake user agents to bypass anti-scraping mechanisms employed by some websites, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted scraping process. The scraped data is then saved locally in a structured JSON file for further analysis and usage.

## Features
- Web scraping of book data from a website
- Rotation of fake user agents to avoid detection
- Storage of scraped data in a local .json file
- Utilization of items.py file for structured data representation
- Middleware for handling fake user agents

## Project Details
- The scraper is designed to crawl 50 pages of the target website.
- It collects data on a total of 1000 books.
- The collected data includes various details about each book.

## Notes
- This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the capabilities of web scraping with Scrapy.
- Web scraping plays a crucial role in data extraction for AI and ML applications, enabling researchers and developers to gather relevant and diverse datasets for training machine learning models.
